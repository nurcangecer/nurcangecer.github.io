			<h2> Abstract <h2>
			<p align="justify">
				A multitude of studies in economics, psychology, politics, and social sciences have demonstrated the wisdom of crowds (WoC) phenomenon,  where the aggregation of information in groups results in decisions that are often better than what could be made by any single member of the group.  While WoC is observable in such domains where the participating individuals have experience or familiarity with the question at hand, it remains unclear how effective WoC is for domains that traditionally require deep expertise, sophisticated computational models, or a combination of the two to arrive at objectively optimal solutions. In particular, this work explores how effective WoC is for engineering design   problems that are esoteric in nature, that is, problems (1) whose solutions traditionally require expertise and specialized knowledge, (2) where access to experts can be costly or infeasible, and (3) in which previous WoC studies with the general population have been shown to be highly ineffective. The main hypothesis in this work is that in the absence of experts,  WoC  can be observed in groups that consist of practitioners who are defined to have a base familiarity with the problems in question even though no single individual may have the expertise to correctly solve the problem. Additionally, as a way to emulate commonly encountered engineering problem solving scenarios, this work studies WoC  with practitioners that form micro-crowds consisting of 4 to 15 individuals (rather than tens of individuals), thereby giving rise to the term the wisdom of micro-crowds (WoMC) which is central to the presented work.  Our studies on design  evaluations show that WoMC produces  results whose mean is in the 80th percentile or better across varying crowd sizes, even for problems that are highly non-intuitive in nature.   However, the performance of WoMC with practitioners declines significantly when assessing  solutions to a set of open-ended, conceptual design problems where no true solution exists in the solution set.
